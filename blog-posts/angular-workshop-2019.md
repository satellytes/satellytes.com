This is about the technical project of our 3-day Angular Advanced Workshop we gave for KaiserX (Allianz) to teach advanced topics of Angular v7 in a unique & playful way by implementing a card game called Skip-Bo. The workshop covered the six chapters, Modules, Components, Routing, RxJS, Testing & Animations, split into theory & challenges. 

<!-- stop excerpt -->

> Note (2021): The concepts are still very valid, even though the version Angular v7 is outdated today.

This week an intense month of planning, preparing & developing an *Advanced Angular Workshop* ended with the workshop itself. Over three days, 15 developers listened to six chapters, each with a theory and a challenge. Every theory part (~1h) is accompanied by a challenge (~2h ) to implement a full card game application. I chose [Skip-Bo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skip-Bo) as it's a well-known game, and the rules are easy to grasp.

The workshop was a huge success. I'm so __proud__ of every single participant. They were so focused during my theory part and successfully completed all six chapters üí™ I can tell you those challenges were pretty tricky. I planted nifty bugs to fix. There were RxJS streams to create and animations to build.

## Try it

You can play with the final project online under
[skipbo-angular-workshop.netlify.com](https://skipbo-angular-workshop.netlify.com) and access the complete source & challenges under [github.com/georgiee/angular-workshop-skipbo](https://github.com/georgiee/angular-workshop-skipbo)


Below a gif preview. Additionally, I have prepared a [short video](https://www.youtube.com/embed/xKlta_T3qgs) of the gameplay part on YouTube.

## It's Open Source üéâ
The workshop is Open Source, because we don't want to lock away valuable information ‚Äî it's about teaching Angular to the community.

We decided to put the workshop on [GitHub](https://github.com/georgiee/angular-workshop-skipbo) and make it Open Source. That way, many more people can go through the workshop on their own. Other fellow developers can even take the workshop and create their own ones too!

We hope you enjoy it.


## Workshop Content
Please check the linked [GitHub project](https://github.com/georgiee/angular-workshop-skipbo) for all details. I will only give a brief summary of the content.

The [workshop project](https://github.com/georgiee/angular-workshop-skipbo) gives you access to all six chapters (theory & challenge). Here the [slides](https://www.slideshare.net/GeorgiosKaleadis/angular-advanced-workshop-challenges) from the workshop.


Inside the project, you will find a git submodule `skipbo-angular` ‚Äî that's the actual Angular project. This project includes around 50 branches in the following structure.

- workshop/04-rxjs-start
- workshop/04-rxjs-progress-01
- workshop/04-rxjs-progress-02
- workshop/04-rxjs-progress-03
- workshop/04-rxjs-end
- workshop/05-testing-start
- ...

Those branches help struggling participants to quickly catch up. In addition, by creating mandatory branches to check out, I can fast-forward to specific milestones (chapters) without leaving people behind.

The following content lists the chapter introductions for the participants, so you can feel how we proceeded through the workshop.

### Chapter I - Modules
We start slowly with a recap of what Modules are and their special role in Angular. The Injection System is tightly bound to the module world, so it's a good moment to revise them in this chapter.

## Conclusion
Preparing a new workshop is time-consuming, especially if you want to craft a unique and challenging experience beyond the typical tutorials. After endless hours of preparations, we were able to deliver and fulfill the expectations. We did not repeat the workshop since then, as we focused on our project-based business, but we are happy to talk about any future possibility if you would like to enjoy a similar experience.
