## Project setup

To run the project all you need is:

- Yarn
- Node >= 16

### Additional setup on Apple Silicon

If you are using a machine with Apple Silicon, the `canvas` dependency might not have prebuild binaries, therefore the installation fails.

To fix that, you need to [install the dependencies needed to compile](https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas#compiling) the binaries first (using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)):

```bash
brew install pkg-config cairo pango libpng jpeg giflib librsvg
```

### Environment Variables

It is necessary to create a dotenv (`.env.development`) to develop locally.

| Variable Name                     | Decription                              |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID`             | your Contentful space ID                |
| `CONTENTFUL_ACCESS_TOKEN`         | your  content delivery API access token |
| `CONTENTFUL_PREVIEW_ACCESS_TOKEN` | your  content preview API access token  |
| `CONTENTFUL_HOST`                 | preview.contentful.com                  |

Then you can use the following commands to start development:

```sh
# install dependencies
yarn

# start local dev server
yarn start

# create a production build
yarn build

# serve the production build
yarn serve
```

A production build of the website gets created for every pull request. You will get the link as pull request comment.

## Component development with Storybook

This repository comes with [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/). Storybook helps to develop and understand the single components of the website by showing them in isolation.

Use the following commands to start working with Storybook:

```sh
# install dependencies
yarn

# start storybook
yarn storybook

# create a production build
yarn storybook:build

# serve the production bui√∂d
yarn storybook:serve
```

A production build of Storybook gets be created for every pull request. You will get the link as pull request comment. 
For the `main` branch, the build can be found here: https://satellytes-website-storybook.netlify.app
