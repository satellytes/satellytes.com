This week an intense month of planning, preparing & developing an Advanced Angular Workshop ended with the workshop itself. Over the course of three days, 15 developers listened to six chapters each with a theory and a challenge part. Every theory part (~1h) is accompanied by a challenge (~2h ) with the goal to implement a full card game application. I chose Skip-Bo as it's a well known game and the rules are easy to grasp.

The workshop was a huge success. I'm so proud of every single participant. They were so focused during my theory part and you successfully completed all six chapters ðŸ’ª I can tell you those challenges were pretty difficult. I planted nifty bugs to fix, there were RxJS streams to create and animations to build.

You can play with the final project online. https://skipbo-angular-workshop.netlify.com

Here a quick video of the gameplay part.
