Dear colleagues,

learn how to properly write a blog post – in terms of formatting – so that everything is rendered properly & our blog looks super shiny. 💫
<!-- end -->

# Basics

In general, we use Markdown to write our blog posts with the common formatting possibilities. If you need a refresher, feel free to check out the possible (& parsed) formats at the end of this blog post. ~~One specialty: if you use a `# heading level one`, it will become the page's H1 – not the title defined in the frontmatter. This title will only show up on the preview card, which can be useful, if your title is horribly long. 😉 Another: if your post starts immediatly with a headline, the preview card won't have a fancy preview text. 😱~~   🤷‍♀️

* heading rendering
* frontmatter incl. date format
* all funky markdown formats

# Level 1 Heading

In general we use markdown to write blog posts with the common formatting possibilities. So to write plain text, just get typing. An example of headings you see throughout the whole blog post. Keep in mind, that in the frontmatter, the date needs to be in the format "yyyy-mm-dd".

You can also add code with syntax highlighting. Simply add the language after the first three backticks of a codeblock for example `` ```js``

```js
const test = 1;
console.log("Hi", test);
```
