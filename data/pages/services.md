### Enterprise Applications & Libraries

We have extensive experience in developing modern and reliable web applications for the insurance,
banking and automotive industries. Angular has become the standard technology for such applications. We
bring in-depth experience with this technology and provide you with a customized solution to any
problem.

We are also very experienced in implementing holistic platforms - for example, an infrastructure of
Angular libraries, setting up CI/CD pipelines and implementing well-tested applications in multiple languages and configurations.

Moreover, we are professionals in developing Java backends in all variations. We are experienced in the connection of
systems, the development of new versioned APIs and the specific connection of frontend applications based on
BFF (Backend for Frontend) - or completely decentralized microservices.

### UX & UI

With around 20 years of experience in the design and implementation of digital interfaces, we cover the entire spectrum of the

much more relevant for achieving your business goals. Because only with user-friendly, easily
user-friendly, easy-to-understand journeys across all end devices, user groups, and usage contexts, users - and therefore
you - reach your goal.

For our enterprise customers, we conceptualize and design websites with modern, ergonomic and well thought-out
UX standards and best practices, adhere to accessibility guidelines, constantly test, measure and, if desired, provide all components in a well-structured and expandable design system.
