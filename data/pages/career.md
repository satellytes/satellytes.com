Satellytes - that are currently 14 exclusively passionate developers and designers. We enjoy technology and look forward to new challenges. We focus on long-term engagements in the group business.

We always approach new tasks with appropriate respect. We always strive for high-quality and contemporary solutions - the choice of technology is secondary for us.

Our [office](/office/) is located in a beautiful old building in the heart of Munich, in Sendlinger Stra√üe, not far from the subway station of the same name. Within walking distance there are not only dozens of stores, cafes, restaurants and the famous Viktualienmarkt, but also various smaller and larger parks. Even the Isar river can be reached on foot or by subway in just 3 minutes during the lunch break.
