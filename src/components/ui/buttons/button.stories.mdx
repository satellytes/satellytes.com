# Button

There are multiple Button components for different situations.
They all take all the props of a normal `<button>`, e.g. the `onClick` property.

## Regular

This is the Regular Button, which should be used in all the standard use cases. Pass the `label` as `children` to the Button.

<Canvas withSource="open">
  <Story name="Regular">
    <Button onClick={() => console.log('Regular Button clicked')}>
      Submit
    </Button>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

<ArgsTable of={Button}/>

## Button vs. Anchors

This component can be used both as a button and as an anchor. If the `to` prop is provided, the component is rendered as an anchor. Otherwise, the component is rendered as a button. Here you can read why this distinction is useful: https://bitsofco.de/anchors-vs-buttons/

<Canvas withSource="open">
  <Story name="Button as Link">
    <Button to={'https://www.example.com/'}>
      Link
    </Button>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## IconButton

This is the Icon Button. It is always of the size `24x24` and it shows one of the icons specified [here](?path=/docs/components-icon--regular).

The `icon` property of IconButton defines which Icon will be displayed.

<ArgsTable of={IconButton} />

<Canvas withSource="open">
  <Story name="WithIcon">
    <IconButton
      onClick={() => console.log('Icon Button clicked')}
      icon="clone"
    />
  </Story>
</Canvas>
