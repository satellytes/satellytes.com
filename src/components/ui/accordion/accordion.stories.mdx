# Accordion
An accordion is a vertically stacked group of collapsible sections. Our accordion is based on the [Accordion](https://reach.tech/accordion/) from ReachUI. We have baked in many of our configuration and design decisions which makes it easier to use. 

**Some notable things:**

+ Every accordion receives internally the toggles `multiple` & `collapsible` which you can't remove. 
+ `AccordionContent` is the only child component to define your content.
+ You can't define your own `AccordionButton`, `AccordionPanel` and such, everything is predefined and bundled in the `AccordionContent` component.

## Component API

<ArgsTable of={Accordion} />

### Accordion
The wrapper component for all other accordion components. Each accordion component must be a `<AccordionContent/>` component.
You can define which section to open first through `defaultIndex` and you can pass in an array to open multiple sections too. 

<Canvas>
  <Story story={AccordionContainerExample}/>
</Canvas>

### AccordionContent
The `AccordionContent` component is the bread and butter of the Accordion. For each component you can pass in the `title`, `illustration` and the actual content through `children`. The illustration is optional and will push the content aside accordingly.

<Canvas>
  <Story story={AccordionSectionExample}/>
</Canvas>

## Animation

The animation can't be configured. It's based on [react-spring](https://react-spring.io/hooks/use-spring).
