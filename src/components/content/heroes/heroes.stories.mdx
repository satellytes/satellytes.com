# Blog Hero
> Due to the gatsby image dependency no preview is available.

This hero behaves very similar to the `ImageHero` but you can pass in two additional things: `attribution` and a squared image
that will be used once the website is very narrow (higher than wide) to present a more pleasant part from the feature image.


```tsx
<BlogHero
  attribution={
    {
      creator: "My Source;
      source: "http://www.example.com;
    }
  }
  image={featuredImage}
  imageSquare={featuredImageSquared}
/>
```


You can query for both images in a single graphql query. Pass `aspectRatio: 1` to get a square image.

```graphql
featuredImage {
  childImageSharp {
    gatsbyImageData(layout: FULL_WIDTH, placeholder: BLURRED)
  }
}

featuredImageSquared: featuredImage {
  childImageSharp {
    gatsbyImageData(
      aspectRatio: 1
      layout: FULL_WIDTH
      placeholder: BLURRED
    )
  }
}
```
