# Button

There are multiple Button components for different situations. They all take an `onClick` property to control its functionality.
The displayed values are passed as `children` property. Only the valid types of those property differ for the different components.

### Overview of Buttons

---

#### Regular

This is the Regular Button, which should be used in all the standard use cases. Pass the `label` as `children` to the Button.

<Canvas withSource="open">
  <Story name="Regular">
    <Button onClick={() => console.log('Regular Button clicked')} children="">
      Alle Services
    </Button>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

#### IconButton

This is the Icon Button. It is always of the size `24x24`. You can choose the displayed Icon by passing an [Icon](?path=/docs/components-icon--regular) as children.

When passing an Icon to the Button, you have to use the default size (that is `IconSize.NORMAL`, but just leave out the size property).

<Canvas withSource="open">
  <Story name="WithIcon">
    <IconButton onClick={() => console.log('Icon Button clicked')}>
      <Icon show="clone" />
    </IconButton>
  </Story>
</Canvas>
