# Button

Those components offer multiple styled Buttons for different situations. They all take a `onClick` property to control its functionality.
Beyond this property the single components differ a little bit in use.

### Overview of Buttons

---

#### Regular

This is the Regular Button, which should be used in all the standard use cases. Pass the `label` as `children` to the Button.

<Canvas>
  <Story story={Regular} />
</Canvas>

#### IconButton

This is the Icon Button. It is always of the size `24x24`. You can choose the displayed Icon by passing an <a href="/docs/components-icon--regular">Icon</a>.

When passing an Icon to the Button, you have to:

- use the default size `IconSize.NORMAL`
- choose your wanted color of the icon by wrapping it in a Container with that color as font color

<Canvas>
  <Story story={WithIcon} />
</Canvas>
