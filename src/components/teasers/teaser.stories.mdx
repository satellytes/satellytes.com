# Teaser

Teasers are used to link to another page and give the user a brief overview of the content of that page.
This requires a `headline`, the path to the page (`linkTo`) and a short text, which is entered as a child.
In addition, an illustration or an image (`cover`), a formatted date (`dateFormatted`) and a `topline` can be displayed.

## Teaser Layouts
