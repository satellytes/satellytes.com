# Image

The ContentBlock/Image Component can be used to display pictures with a description and an optional `attribution` tag in the bottom right corner.
The image itself is passed as children. (e.g. as GatsbyImage Component, but always with `width: 100%;`for correct layouting).

The `textAlign` property defines where the text is displayed.
Valid values are: `right`, `left`, `bottom`.
