component to render the job description.

        { headline: 'First', descriptionHtml: 'some <em>normal</em> html' },
        {
          headline: 'Second',
          descriptionHtml: `some <strong>other</strong> html`,
        },
        { headline: 'Third', descriptionHtml: 'some <u>better</u> html' },
      ]}
    />
  </Story>
</Canvas>

<ArgsTable of={JobDescription} />
