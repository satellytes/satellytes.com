# Teaser

Teasers are used to link to another page and give the user a brief overview of the content of that page.
This requires a `headline` and a short text, which is entered as a child.
In addition, an `illustration` or an `image`, a formatted date (`dateFormatted`), a link to another page (`linkTo`) and a `topline` can be displayed.
You can't pass in an image **and** illustration. If you pass in an image and illustration the illustration will be taken.
